# indie_SAGE Technical Publishing Working Group #iSTPWG

â€” Innovating Rapid Publishing for COVID-19

A volunteer research working group to provide technical publishing assistance for The Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) in the fight against COVID.

Here you can see a pilot example of converting an existing [PDF report](https://www.independentsage.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Independent-Sage-Brief-Report-on-Schools.pdf) into a multi-format publication and applying basics DOI, ISBN identifiers and metadata - web, screen PDF, ebook, print-on-demand, and as HTML source. See results: [Should Schools Reopen?](https://independent-sage.github.io/Should-Schools-Reopen/#/)

## Work group volunteers!

The working group is looking for volunteers and resources to help in the rapid publishing, dissemination and innovations for public engagement of indie_SAGE publications.
