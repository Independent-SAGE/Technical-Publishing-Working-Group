# indie_SAGE Technical Publishing Working Group #iSTPWG

â€” Innovating Rapid Publishing for COVID-19

A volunteer research working group to provide technical publishing assistance for The Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (indie_SAGE) in the fight against COVID.

Here you can see a pilot example of converting an existing [PDF report](https://www.independentsage.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Independent-Sage-Brief-Report-on-Schools.pdf) into a multi-format publication and applying basics DOI, ISBN identifiers and metadata - web, screen PDF, ebook, print-on-demand, and as HTML source. See results: [Should Schools Reopen?](https://independent-sage.github.io/Should-Schools-Reopen/#/) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3935529.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3935529)
